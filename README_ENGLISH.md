The <b>Click-to-Chat</b> feature enables you to start a chat with someone without having to store the person's phone number in your phone book. As long as you know this person's phone number, you can create a link that will enable you to chat with them. By clicking on a link, a chat with that person will open automatically. <b>Click to Chat works either on your phone or WhatsApp Web.</b>
